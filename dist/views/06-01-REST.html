<h1>The JSON Format</h1>

<p>JSON , or JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.</p>

    <h4>JSON is natively interpreted by JavaScript!!!</h4>
</div>

<h1>REST (Decoupling front and back end)</h1>

<p>Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of constraints applied to components, connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system. REST ignores the details of component implementation and protocol syntax in order to focus on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements</p>
